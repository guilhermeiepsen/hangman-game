-Remember: strings must always be declared with 1 index more than the actual size of it. The '\0' is the reason of it. If this is not done, memory garbage could be shown 
in the game, or even worse in this case, the secretWord could be shown, as it is storing random things in this string. 

-Commands from the library stdlib.h might need to be replaced for the script to run properly in systems other than windows, as these commands are "lent" from the windows
system.

-Building and running properly with VSCode: ALWAYS: Ctrl+S and then Build+Run.

-The Running of the script is not the same in the VSCode terminal and in the windows cmd prompt. In the windows cmd prompt and online gbd the script runs properly, 
whereas in the VSCode terminal, problems still occur. (Such as secretWord being shown in the mistakenLetters array.) (dont know why)

-Be aware: the powerShell or any other open console at the time you're building could be a problem.
