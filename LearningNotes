-Remember: strings must always be declared with 1 index more than the actual size of it. The '\0' is the reason of it. If this is not done, memory garbage could be shown 
in the game, or even worse in this case, the secretWord could be shown, as it is storing random things in this string. 

-Commands from the library stdlib.h might need to be replaced for the script to run properly in systems other than windows, as these commands are "lent" from the windows
system.

-Building and running properly with VSCode: ALWAYS: Ctrl+S and then Build+Run.

-When you want to increment/decrement a variable that is a pointer, parenthesis are needed. E.g.: (*chances) --; (*sizeMistakenLetters) ++; Otherwise, it won't work.
